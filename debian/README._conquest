_conquest user and group accounts
---------------------------------

Debian Policy is silent wrt how system accounts are created and named by
packages, except when talking about base-passwd accounts (UID < 100).
Considering discussion in bugs 228692, 291177 and 621833, following the
threads http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/11/msg02231.html and
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/11/msg00343.html and as is written
in the wiki (https://wiki.debian.org/AccountHandlingInMaintainerScripts),
there are some de facto best practices that this package try to follow:

(*) The account name follows common convention of using an underscore as a
prefix to package name (except that our package name is too lenghty, so I
shortened it to _conquest);

(*) The account is created in postinst script and everything that should be
owned by the account is chowned so;

(*) The account is removed in postrm if purging the package, but the logfiles
and images eventually dropped in the /var/lib subdirectory are preserved and
chowned root:root
